The labyrinthine corridors within are the last challenge you must win before coming face to face with the Demon Lord. Leave Rosethorn Keep behind and take the march alongside your companions to finish your quest and save the world.

The presence of the Demon Lord has been plaguing the land around Rosethorn Keep and beyond for a very long time – but he has only grown in power since.

After reaching Tier 5 in your Great Hall, you unlock the ability to vanquish the evil of the Demon Lord. Bring all of your companions. There are seven events to complete, and each success will reduce the TNs of both Demon Lord checks by one.
