\chapter{Dungeons}

To calculate the total Resources you bring back to the castle, multiply the dungeon’s Base Resources by the number of events completed successfully. Remember to add the tier of your Stables to both Resources before multiplying by the amount of successful events.

\skipline

At Tiers 2 \& 3, roll \textbf{2d6} per companion to determine the event. At Tiers 4 \& 5, roll \textbf{3d6} per companion to determine the event.

If you bring more than five companions, you also fight the Boss. This is automatic and replaces one of the dungeon’s events. To defeat bosses, companions must overcome both TNs listed.
